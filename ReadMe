1. Creates Dynamic Library(Libs/Libdinsle.So) Which Provides File_Reader, File_Writer, Matrix And Result Classes, Also Read_Sle, Read_Result, Write_Sle_Solution Functions
 
2. Runs Gaussian_Elimination From Main.Cpp (Sources)

3. Testing Phase (Test)


folder/Din_Lib:
	file_reader.cpp:
		class File_Reader  //read info from file

	file_writer.cpp:
		class File_Writer  //write information to file

	sle_matrix.cpp:
		class Matrix  //Matrix class is used to describe the system's coefficients (A) 
			
		class Result   //The class Result describes the solution of a system of linear equations.

	utility.cpp:
		//The function reads the coefficients(A) and b vector as matrices. 
		bool Read_SLE(File_Reader&, Matrix&, Matrix&);
	
		
		//The function simply reads the solution data and assigns it to the corresponding class Result object methods.
		bool Read_Result(File_Reader&, Result&);
	
		bool Write_SLE_Solution(File_Writer&, const Matrix&, std::string&);

folder/Sources:
	main.cpp:
		Reading system of linera equation as a matrix, and after Gaussian_Elimination implementation writes results to the file.

	gaussian_elimination.cpp:
		Create_Augmented_Matrix(Matrix&, Matrix&, Matrix&)

		Variable_Elemination(Matrix&);  //changing to upper triangular matrix besides last column 

		Backward_Substitution(Matrix& AM, Matrix& X_out, std::string& conclusion_out, float epsilon)

		//epsilon is necessary to take into account the behavioral deviations of float number..
		Gaussian_Elimination (Matrix& A, Matrix& B, Matrix& X_out, std::string& conclusion_out, float epsilon)

folder/Test:
	test_comparator.cpp: //This code compares the output file with the gold output using epsilon precision
	
	//The test results are presented in "test_comparator_result.txt" file (Data folder)

	
	test_variables_lacement.cpp
